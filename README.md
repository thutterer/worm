## a snake-like game written in C++ with ncurses
this game is the result of me learning about pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
it was meant to be a proof-of-concept not the most polished game ever.
if you like the idea, you'll have plenty of room to improve it.

# the roughest edges
- the network mode works well enough to prove a point but not smooth enough to regulary use it.
if the client tries to connect before the server started, the client quits, for example.
- there is no persistant highscore.
- the controlling-function is way to ugly.
- there is no help or documentation.
